Summary
=======

BlocJams is an online music streaming service built with AngularJS and [Buzz library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/){:target="_blank"}.


Explanation
============

BlocJams was made for users to stream their favorite music.

Problem
========

Now days most people are on the go and it's difficult for music lovers to own every album or song they enjoy. BlocJams allows users to stream their favorite songs online without much hassle.


Results
========

BlocJams was coded at first with vanilla javascript and jQuery then refactored with AngularJS. The angular version was definitely easier to manage from a developer's perspective. I truly enjoyed working on this since I am a big music fan and this gave me background on how my favorite music apps could be coded.
