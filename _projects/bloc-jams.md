**Summary**

Blocitoff is a web app that let’s you create a to-do list that keeps you productive by automatically deleting the tasks not marked as completed within 7 days.  


**Explanation**

This web application was made with the intent to help users remember tasks by keeping a relevant to-do list.

**Problem**

Given that in today’s society there are plenty of distractions, it would be nice to have an app that would keep your most important to-do tasks together to keep you focused.

**Solution**

Blocitoff solves this issue by allowing you to create a to-do list in which you’re able to mark off when something has been completed. In addition to this, Blocitoff automatically deletes items that have not been marked as “completed” after 7 days. This will assure you that only the most important daily or weekly tasks will be on your to-do list keeping you focused.

**Results**

I tried having a checkbox that would allow you to select multiple to-do items at once, but this proved to not be as successful as a simple checkmark. 

**Conclusion**

I found that Blocitoff is a great web app to keep you organized and focused throughout your week. I do find that it will need to make more improvements as more users begin to use it.
