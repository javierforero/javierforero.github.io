Snapshot
========

BlocJams is web app that simulates an online, music streaming service. It was built with AngularJS and [Buzz library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I first coded Blocjams using vanilla javascript and jQuery then refactored with AngularJS. The angular version was definitely easier to manage from a developer's perspective. I truly enjoyed working on this since I am a big music fan and this gave me background on how my favorite music apps could be coded.
