Snapshot
========

ChatMe is chatroom web app built with AngularJS and Firebase.

The idea here was to allow users to join multiple chatrooms and have topic based conversations. Perhaps users can make new friends or expand their professional network.

I had fun working on this one because I had always wondered how gchat worked and this gave me insight into how a regular chat app would work.

Some of the features I plan to add in the future are a user profile, private chatrooms, email notifications, and hashtags.
