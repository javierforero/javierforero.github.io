Snapshot
============

Meltedradio is a web app that uses the Youtube API to allow users to browse and create
video playlist. The site is being built on AngularJS for the front-end and Rails API for the back-end.

The app is still in development, but it will be deployed in early June 2017.
In the meantime please see the source code and the screenshots from its development
stages.
