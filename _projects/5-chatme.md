    <h2>Snapshot</h2>
    <p>ChatMe is chatroom web app built with AngularJS and Firebase.</p>
    <p>The idea here was to allow users to join multiple chatrooms and have topic based conversations. Perhaps users can make new friends or expand their professional network.</p>
    <p>Some of the features I plan to add in the future are a user profiles, private chatrooms, email notifications, and hashtags.</p>
