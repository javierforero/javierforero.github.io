Summary
=======

Blocchat is chatroom web app built with AngularJS and firebase.


Explanation
============

This web app is a chat room app where users can join multiple chatrooms
and have topic based conversations.

Problem
========

People need to connect with each other to either make new friends or expand their professional network.

Solution
========

BlocChat is perfect for this because it allows users to choose a chat room of their choice and connect with other people that have the same interests. Also, if there's no chat room that matches the user's interest, they can create one.


Results
=======

To test this, I had different friends use BlocChat to find out if they'd use it on a regular basis. A lot of the feedback I received was on its usability and features they would like to add. For instance, a user profile, private chat rooms, email notifications, and hashtags.



Conclusion
==========

I believe BlocChat does complete the task it set out to do. I do think that some of these features of enhancements could make the user experience a lot better and will be added in futures versions of this web app.
