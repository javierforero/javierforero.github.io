Summary
=======

Blocchat is chatroom web app that uses AngularJS and firebase.


Explanation
============

This web app is a chat room app where users can join multiple chatrooms
and have topic based conversations.

Problem
========

People need to connect and what better way then to create a web app
that will allow users to join topic based chat rooms to connect with other people.

Solution
========

Blocitoff solves this issue by allowing you to create a to-do list in which you’re able to mark off when something has been completed. In addition to this, Blocitoff automatically deletes items that have not been marked as “completed” after 7 days. This will assure you that only the most important daily or weekly tasks will be on your to-do list keeping you focused.

Results
=======

I tried having a checkbox that would allow you to select multiple to-do items at once, but this proved to not be as successful as a simple checkmark. 

Conclusion
==========

I found that Blocitoff is a great web app to keep you organized and focused throughout your week. I do find that it will need to make more improvements as more users begin to use it.
