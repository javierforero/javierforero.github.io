Snapshot
========

Blocitoff is a web app that let’s you create a to-do list that keeps you productive by automatically deleting the tasks not marked as completed within 7 days.  
This app was built using Ruby on Rails.

I found that Blocitoff is a great web app to keep you organized and focused throughout your week. I do find that it will need to make more improvements as more users begin to use it.
