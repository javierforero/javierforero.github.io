    <h2>Snapshot</h2>
    <p>This was collaborative project with the team at <a href="http://aislerocket.com/" target="_blank">Aisle Rocket Studios</a></p>
    <p>The scope of the project was to build an experience for Whirlpool customers where they design their perfect kitchen.</p>
    <p>I worked on the suite section creating layout, animations and making the site responsive.</p>
    <p>Check out the staging site <a href="https://stage.whirlpool.com/kitchen/kitchen-styles.html?cache=1007" target="_blank">here</a></p>
