title: Goals as a developer
---

Nobody really knows exactly what they're gonna do in life and even if they do, we can all agree that the future is uncharted territory. For me being exactly one of those vagrants in life is what led me to web development. It all started in college when I took an introductory course in object oriented programming. This is where I got my first taste of coding. One of the very first assignments in the class was to code a cash register, and I was just amazed that I was able to communicate logic to my computer. This really blew my mind; however, due to life's distractions I didn't end up getting a degree in computer science.

A year after graduating, I started playing in a band and we needed a website. One of my buddies at the time was a designer and didn't want a cookie cutter site. So I took on the challenge to try to figure it out. Obviously, the challenge was over my head at the time, but after many google searches and one badly coded site, I felt happy and I wanted to learn more. So here I am.

As a web developer, I want to be able to merge art and technology and make really cool sites. Just by surfing the web you can find so many developers doing cool stuff and influencing how technology serves humans. All I could think is "alright, I better hurry and get there soon."
