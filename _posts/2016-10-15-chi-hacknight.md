I have been going to tech meetups to meet other developers as well as to learn more about developing. Most recently I went to one called ChiHacknight. This meetup is pretty cool.

The meeting starts off with a guest speaker usually discussing some new technology or sharing a project he or she worked on and then it breaks up into different groups whom are working on different web apps.

I decided to join a group that's working on a web app called Tweechable.
Tweechable is an automatic education Twitter service that provides lessons when mentioned. It basically has a bot that provides well-written responses to Tweets.
I'm excited to start contributing to this project!
