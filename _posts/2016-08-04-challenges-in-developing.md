title: Challenges while developing Alexa Skills
---

Hi there! So I decided to write a few skills for Amazon's Echo, a device that uses a voice service that is called Alexa. The cool thing about this service is that it is cloud-based so Alexa keeps getting smarter as more developers code skills for her. I figured since I like playing music, coding for speech interaction would be super fun. Also, Amazon was offering a free echo through Bloc and I couldn't pass that up.
